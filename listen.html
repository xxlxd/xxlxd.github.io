			  <li>Here are the top stories today:
A giant crocodile attacked a man walking his dog along a river in Australia. Fortunately, the man beats the beast back with a rock as the man's dog bites the reptile1 on the face. Both man and dog suffered minor2 injuries but are expected to recover.
 <br/>
Next, a huge tornado3 catches a woman trapped in her vehicle and carries her a quarter of a mile from town. The woman suffered a broken leg and minor neck injuries, but she was more worried about her cat swept away by the storm. She's offering a $1,000 reward for her feline4 friend.
<br/>	
In another part of the world, a man gets his hand stuck in a kitchen garbage disposal and is trapped for three days. His cries went unanswered until breaking the kitchen window and signaling for help with a fire extinguisher. The man said that his wedding ring disappeared down the disposal, and he was trying to fish it out.
<br/>	 
And finally, a Canadian family of four gets lost trying to drive across a mountain pass in a blizzard5 and is stranded6 for a week, surviving on a banana, 10 cheese crackers7, and a cooked ham. Temperatures dipped to fifteen below as the family stays warm by singing Christmas carols. The family is finally rescued after the father hikes fifteen miles to get help.
