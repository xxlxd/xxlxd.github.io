                <p>The most unusual museum in London is the Science Museum. In most museums, there’s no shouting and no running, and you aren’t allowed to touch the exhibits(展品). But the Science Museum is different, because it’s noisy! People talk about what they can see and do there, and some of the machines are noisy as well. Visiting the Science Museum is fun and it’s a great way to learn about science because you can work things out and try out ideas.<br />When I visit the Science Museum, I go to the Launch Pad. This is my favourite room because you can do physics experiments. For example, if you want to fill a bag with&nbsp; falling sand, you have to move a kind of truck on wheels into the correct position. I also go to the Rocket Show. You can learn how we travel into space and back again.<br />Then I go upstairs to Human and Nature room. You can compare your speed with animals there. You hear a noise and push a button(按钮). If you aren’t fast enough, the lion catches you! I’m faster than all my friends, but the lion still catches me.<br />There are also rooms on transport, the environment and space technology, as well as maths, physics and chemistry.<br />You can do a lot of things in this museum, but you have to obey some rules as well. For example, you mustn’t take photos of the exhibits in the museum. But you can buy postcards of them in the museum shops.<br />Above all, the Science Museum is free. That means you can drop in for a few minutes or you can stay as long as you like—it’s open every day, from 10 am to 6 pm. So if you ever go to London, make sure you visit the Science Museum. It’s my favourite museum in the whole world.<br />
